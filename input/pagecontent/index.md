### Summary 
This implementation guide includes a machine-readable representation of WHO guidelines for immunization, as documented in the WHO Digital Adaptation Kit: SMART Guidelines for Immunizations (link forthcoming) and explicitly encodes computer-interoperable logic, including data models, terminologies, and logic expressions, in a computable language to support implementation of immunization use cases in Kenya.
